# PeerT — Travel Companion Backend

PeerT is a travel companion application designed to help users plan, organize, and manage their trips in a single place.

This repository contains the **backend service**, built with **Node.js and TypeScript**, following **Clean Architecture principles**. The backend is responsible for handling business logic, integrations with external travel-related APIs, and user-specific data management.

---

## 🚀 Project Vision

PeerT aims to become a smart travel assistant that helps users:

- Organize trips and destinations
- Plan itineraries and activities
- Track expenses and bookings
- Retrieve contextual travel information such as weather, currency exchange, and flight options
- Compare travel options and offers based on user preferences

The application is designed to evolve incrementally, starting from a solid domain-driven backend.

---

## 🧱 Architecture

The backend follows **Clean Architecture**, with clear separation of concerns:

- **Domain**  
  Core business entities and value objects. No framework or infrastructure dependencies.

- **Application**  
  Use cases that orchestrate business rules and domain logic.

- **DataAccess**  
  Implementations for repositories and integrations with external services and APIs.

- **API**  
  HTTP layer (Express) exposing the backend functionality.

This structure ensures scalability, testability, and long-term maintainability.

## 🌍 External APIs & Integrations (Planned)

This project is designed to integrate with multiple third-party APIs to enrich the travel experience, centralizing data from different providers into a single backend (BFF-style architecture).

Below is a list of **tentative APIs** selected based on relevance, realism, and learning value.

---

### 🗺️ **:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}**
**Purpose:** Maps, geolocation, and places  
**Use cases:**
- Displaying destinations on maps
- Geocoding and reverse geocoding
- Distance and route calculations
- Autocomplete for destinations and places

Chosen as a flexible and developer-friendly alternative to Google Maps.

---

### ✈️ **:contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}**
**Purpose:** Flights and aviation data  
**Use cases:**
- Airport and airline information
- Flight search and offers
- IATA code validation
- Travel planning support

Amadeus provides a realistic travel-tech experience and offers a sandbox environment suitable for development and portfolio projects.

---

### 🏨 **:contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}**
**Purpose:** Accommodation data  
**Use cases:**
- Hotel search by destination
- Basic hotel information and availability
- Price comparisons (where available)

This integration is exploratory and may be used to enrich trip planning with accommodation suggestions.

---

### 🌦️ **:contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}**
**Purpose:** Weather and forecasts  
**Use cases:**
- Current weather per destination
- Forecasts aligned with trip dates
- Weather-based itinerary insights

Weather data significantly improves user experience by adding contextual information to trips.

---

### 🗿 **:contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}**
**Purpose:** Tourist attractions and points of interest  
**Use cases:**
- Discovering landmarks and attractions
- Enriching destinations with cultural and touristic data
- Suggesting activities within a trip itinerary

OpenTripMap is open and well-suited for exploration without heavy commercial restrictions.

---

### 💱 **:contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}**
**Purpose:** Currency conversion  
**Use cases:**
- Budget calculations
- Expense tracking across multiple currencies
- Shared trip expenses

Useful for trips involving multiple countries and currencies.

---

### 🔐 **:contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}**
**Purpose:** Authentication and authorization  
**Use cases:**
- Secure user authentication
- JWT-based access control
- Role and permission management

Auth0 may be used to handle authentication flows while keeping the backend stateless.

---

### 💳 **:contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}**
**Purpose:** Payments and subscriptions  
**Use cases:**
- Subscription management
- Payment flows
- Webhook-based payment events

dLocal is planned as the payment provider, aligning with real-world fintech integrations and subscription-based features.
